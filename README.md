# Optimization of Machine Downtime

##  Project Overview
The pumps manufacturing machinery is experiencing unplanned downtime, leading to a loss in productivity. This unexpected halt disrupts production schedules, increases maintenance costs, and may result in missed delivery deadlines. These challenges impact overall productivity and profitability.

##  Objective
The primary objective of this project is to **minimize unplanned machine downtime** by at least **10%**, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing financial losses.

##  Dataset Understanding
The dataset used for this project consists of:
- **Rows:** 2500
- **Columns:** 16
- **Data Types:**
  - **1 Date column**
  - **3 Categorical (object) columns**
  - **12 Numerical (float) columns**
- **Data Observations:**
  - Missing values are present in the dataset.
  - No duplicate values observed.
  - No null values detected.

##  Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations.
   - Encode categorical variables for machine learning models.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Identify key factors contributing to downtime.
   - Create new relevant features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Development:**
   - Train predictive models to identify potential downtimes.
   - Compare different machine learning models for the best performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics to measure model accuracy and effectiveness.
5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained model as a **Streamlit Application** for real-time monitoring and analysis.

##  Model Deployment Strategy
###  Model Integration
- Integrate the trained model into a **Streamlit** application for user-friendly interaction.

###  User Interface
- Design an intuitive **UI** using Streamlit components for easy data input and visualization.

###  Deployment Process
- Deploy the **Streamlit** application to the selected platform for real-world usage.
