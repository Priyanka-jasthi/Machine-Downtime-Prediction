# Machine-Downtime-Prediction
Implemented a predictive maintenance solution for pump manufacturing machinery,
focusing on minimizing unplanned downtime and enhancing productivity. Utilized data preprocessing pipelines,
hyperparameter optimization techniques to fine-tune model performance. Evaluated model effectiveness using
key metrics. Finally, deployed the best model(s) using Streamlit.
